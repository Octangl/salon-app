Problem set

To use ajax to prevent page reload after fom submission. there are two forms on the website, the booking form on the header and the contact form around  the footer.

second problem is to implement appwebsms' sms api that'd send form values to a specifed phone number after every form  submission. here's the link to their documentation https://appwebsms.com/api

the php file named 'before.php' was the former perfectly working form handler just that it didnt implement ajax thus it  had to reload on submission.

I plan to use a modal to display the success message after submission but if you got a better implementation, still cool!

the current state works to an extent.
cheers bro!
